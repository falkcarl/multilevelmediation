Description: The ultimate goal is to support 2-2-1, 2-1-1, and 1-1-1 model for
 multilevel mediation, the option of a moderating variable for either the a, b,
 or both paths, as well as covariates. Currently the 1-1-1 model is supported
 and several options of random effects are supported; the initial underlying
 code for bootstrapping has been evaluated in simulations (see Falk et al in
 references). Support for Bayesian estimation using brms comprises ongoing work.
 Currently only continuous mediators and outcomes are supported. Factors for any
 predictors must be numerically represented.
