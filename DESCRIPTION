Description: The ultimate goal is to support 2-2-1, 2-1-1, and 1-1-1 models for
 multilevel mediation, the option of a moderating variable for either the a, b,
 or both paths, and covariates. Currently the 1-1-1 model is supported
 and several options of random effects; the initial code for bootstrapping was
 evaluated in simulations by Falk, Vogel, Hammami, and Miočević (2024) <doi:10.3758/s13428-023-02079-4>.
 Support for Bayesian estimation using 'brms' comprises ongoing work. Currently
 only continuous mediators and outcomes are supported. Factors for any
 predictors must be numerically represented.
